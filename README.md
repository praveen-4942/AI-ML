## ✅ Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 1 – Python Basics & Operators
- Took two user input numbers
- Performed arithmetic, comparison & logical operations
- Displayed results using formatted output

### ✅ Task 2 – Lists & NumPy
- Generated a list of 10 random integers
- Added & removed elements
- Found max, min, sorted list
- Converted list into NumPy array to calculate:
  ✅ Mean  
  ✅ Median  
  ✅ Standard Deviation

### ✅ Task 3 – Dictionaries & Sets
- Created a student dictionary with marks & grade
- Printed keys & values using loops
- Performed set union, intersection & difference

### ✅ Task 4 – File Handling
- Created `ai_students.txt` file
- Stored 5 student details (name, marks, grade)
- Displayed only students scoring above 75

### ✅ Task 5 – Mini Project (Prompt Logger)
- Python script saves every user prompt with timestamp
- Appends instead of overwriting
- Useful for tracking inputs like an AI chat history
